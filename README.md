## What Did We Just Do?

- **Step 1:** Installed a tool that can download and run programs from the internet
- **Step 2:** Told Claude Desktop where to find your baseball data program
- **Step 3:** Gave the program your database password so it can access your data
- **Step 4:** Tested that everything works

**Total Time:** 10 minutes maximum

## No SQL Knowledge Required!

The system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Finds players by name (partial matching)
- ‚úÖ Joins across all related tables
- ‚úÖ Handles time-based queries
- ‚úÖ Calculates averages and trends
- ‚úÖ Formats results for easy reading

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues?**
- Check your `.env` file has correct database credentials
- Ensure you're on the network that can reach the database

**Installation Problems?**
- Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed
- Try restarting Claude Desktop after adding the configuration

**Questions Not Working?**
- Be specific about player names and what you want to analyze
- Try simpler questions first, then build up complexity

## Support

For help with setup or questions about the data:
- Contact your technical administrator
- Check the database connection is working
- Verify player names exist in the system
