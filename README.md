### Common Issues and Solutions

**üîß Claude Desktop Won't Start After Adding MCP Server**
1. **Close Claude Desktop completely** (quit the application)
2. **Re-open Claude Desktop** - it should create the `.env` file automatically
3. If it still crashes, check the logs:
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp-server-dl-sql-mcp.log`
   - **Mac:** `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-dl-sql-mcp.log`

**üìÅ Can't Find the .env File?**
- **On Windows:** Press `Windows Key + R`, type `%APPDATA%\dl-sql-mcp` and press Enter
- **On Mac:** Press `Command + Space`, type `~/Library/Application\ Support/dl-sql-mcp` and press Enter
- **In Windows Explorer:** Show hidden files (View ‚Üí Hidden items)
- **In Mac Finder:** Press `Command + Shift + .` (period) to show hidden files
- **Alternative commands:**
  - **Windows:** `explorer %APPDATA%\dl-sql-mcp`
  - **Mac:** `open ~/Library/Application\ Support/dl-sql-mcp`
- If the folder doesn't exist, restart Claude Desktop once more

**üîó Database Connection Issues**
- **"Can't connect to MySQL server"** error:
  1. Connect to your organization's VPN first
  2. Verify you can reach the database server:
     - **Windows:** `ping 10.200.200.107` in Command Prompt
     - **Mac:** `ping 10.200.200.107` in Terminal
  3. Check your `.env` file has the correct password (not `CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD`)
  4. Contact IT support if network issues persist

**üîÑ How Many Times to Restart Claude Desktop?**
- **After adding MCP config:** Restart once to create `.env` file
- **After editing password:** Restart once to pick up new credentials
- **If still having issues:** Restart one more time after VPN connection
- **Total expected restarts:** 2-3 times maximum

**‚ö†Ô∏è Server Keeps Disconnecting**
- Check you're connected to the correct network/VPN
- Verify your database credentials are correct
- Look for "Successfully connected" messages in the logs
- If you see "TaskGroup" errors, try restarting Claude Desktop

**üêõ Still Having Problems?**
1. **Check the logs:**
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp-server-dl-sql-mcp.log`
   - **Mac:** `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-dl-sql-mcp.log`
2. **Look for these success messages:**
   - "Created config file at: ..."
   - "Successfully connected to theia_pitching_db!"
   - "Successfully connected to theia_hitting_db!"
3. **Common error patterns:**
   - "Database password not configured" ‚Üí Edit your `.env` file
   - "Can't connect to MySQL server" ‚Üí Check VPN connection
   - "Request timed out" ‚Üí Restart Claude Desktop
