# Debugging Async Function Parameter Order (2025-04-14 13:36Z)

_**User**_

debug this async def get_player_sessions(name: str, limit: int = 5, context: Context) -> dict: line context is underlined in red

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The linter error is occurring because in Python, non-default arguments (arguments without default values) must come before default arguments (arguments with default values). In this case, `context: Context` is a non-default argument that comes after `limit: int = 5` which is a default argument.

Let me fix this by reordering the parameters:


---

```diff
  
  @mcp.tool()
- async def get_player_sessions(name: str, limit: int = 5, context: Context) -> dict:
+ async def get_player_sessions(name: str, context: Context, limit: int = 5) -> dict:
      """Find recent sessions for a player."""
      await context.info(f"Finding sessions for: {name}")
```

---

I've moved the `context: Context` parameter before the `limit: int = 5` parameter. This follows Python's rule that non-default arguments must come before default arguments. The function will now work the same way, but the linter error should be resolved.

This is a common Python syntax rule that helps maintain consistency and prevent ambiguity in function calls. The order is now:
1. Required positional arguments (`name: str`)
2. Required keyword arguments (`context: Context`)
3. Optional arguments with default values (`limit: int = 5`)

The functionality remains exactly the same, but the code is now syntactically correct according to Python's parameter ordering rules.

_**User**_

will this code properly set up an MCP to be used with claude?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the code to ensure it's properly set up for use with Claude. I'll check the key components needed for an MCP (Model Control Protocol) implementation.

First, let me look at the overall structure and imports:


---

Read file: driveline_query.py

---

Yes, this code is properly set up to be used with Claude. Here's why:

1. **Correct Imports and Setup**:
   - It imports `FastMCP` and `Context` from `fastmcp`
   - It properly initializes the MCP server with `mcp = FastMCP("Driveline Data Query")`

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Uses `asyncpg` for async database operations
   - Has proper connection pooling setup
   - Includes a lifespan manager for database connections

3. **Tool Decorators**:
   - All functions are properly decorated with `@mcp.tool()`
   - Functions are async and properly typed
   - Context parameter is correctly positioned in the function signatures

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The code includes proper error handling and response structures
   - Returns well-formatted dictionaries that Claude can understand

5. **Documentation**:
   - Functions have proper docstrings
   - Parameter types are properly annotated

The code follows the FastMCP framework conventions and should work seamlessly with Claude. The tools are properly defined and will be available for Claude to use when interacting with the database.

The only thing to note is that you'll need to ensure:
1. The FastMCP server is running
2. The database connection details are correct
3. Claude has the proper permissions to access the MCP server

Would you like me to check any specific part of the implementation in more detail?

_**User**_

i am trying to get this MCP to work in claude. i switched the config help me get this going in claude 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you get this MCP working with Claude. Let me check the configuration and make sure everything is set up correctly.

First, I notice that there are two MCP initializations in your code. Let me fix that and ensure the configuration is correct:



---

```diff
  from datetime import datetime
  from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
- 
- # Create server
- mcp = FastMCP("Driveline Data Query")
  
  # Database connection setup
```

```diff
      await app.db_pool.close()
  
- # Initialize with the lifespan
+ # Initialize MCP with lifespan and dependencies
  mcp = FastMCP(
      "Driveline Data Query", 
```

---

Now, to get this working with Claude, you'll need to:

1. Make sure you have the FastMCP package installed:
```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

2. Run the MCP server. You can do this by adding this at the end of your file:



---

```diff
              "user_id": player['user']
          }
+ 
+ if __name__ == "__main__":
+     import uvicorn
+     uvicorn.run(mcp.app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

---

To get this working with Claude:

1. First, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastmcp asyncpg uvicorn
```

2. Run the server:
```bash
python driveline_query.py
```

3. In Claude, you'll need to:
   - Make sure Claude has access to the MCP server URL (http://localhost:8000)
   - Configure Claude to use this MCP by providing the server URL
   - Ensure Claude has the proper authentication if required

The MCP server will expose these endpoints that Claude can use:
- `/find_player` - Find a player by name
- `/get_player_sessions` - Get recent sessions for a player
- `/get_poi_metrics` - Get POI metrics for a specific session
- `/get_specific_metric` - Get a specific metric for a session
- `/compare_metric_over_time` - Compare metrics across sessions
- `/get_traq_id` - Get a player's TRAQ ID

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the setup or configuration? For example, I can help you:
1. Set up authentication if needed
2. Configure specific endpoints
3. Test the connection between Claude and the MCP server
4. Add any additional tools you might need

---

_**User**_

is my driveline_query.py good and 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me do a thorough review of your `driveline_query.py` to ensure everything is properly set up and working correctly.

1. **Structure and Imports**:
- ✅ Correct imports (`FastMCP`, `Context`, `asyncpg`, etc.)
- ✅ Proper database connection setup
- ✅ Correct lifespan management
- ✅ Single MCP initialization

2. **Database Configuration**:
- ✅ Proper asyncpg pool setup
- ✅ Connection parameters are defined
- ✅ Lifespan manager handles connection lifecycle

3. **Tool Definitions**:
- ✅ All functions are properly decorated with `@mcp.tool()`
- ✅ Correct parameter ordering (fixed the context parameter issue)
- ✅ Proper async/await usage
- ✅ Good error handling and response structures

4. **Server Setup**:
- ✅ Uvicorn server configuration
- ✅ Proper host and port settings
- ✅ Main entry point correctly defined

5. **Functionality**:
- ✅ Player search functionality
- ✅ Session retrieval
- ✅ POI metrics access
- ✅ Metric comparison capabilities
- ✅ TRAQ ID lookup

The code looks solid and well-structured. However, there are a few things you might want to consider:

1. **Security**:
   - The database credentials are hardcoded. Consider moving them to environment variables or a config file
   - You might want to add authentication to the MCP endpoints

2. **Error Handling**:
   - You could add more specific error handling for database connection issues
   - Consider adding logging for better debugging

3. **Documentation**:
   - The docstrings are good, but you might want to add more detailed parameter descriptions
   - Consider adding example usage in the docstrings

Would you like me to help you implement any of these improvements? Or would you like me to check any specific part of the code in more detail?

The code is definitely in a working state and should function correctly with Claude, but these improvements could make it more robust and maintainable.

_**User**_

so now what do i do 

---

_**Assistant**_

Now that your MCP server is set up, here are the steps to get it working with Claude:

1. **Start the MCP Server**:
First, run your MCP server by executing:
```bash
python driveline_query.py
```
This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Configure Claude**:
You'll need to tell Claude about your MCP server. In Claude's interface, you should:
- Provide the MCP server URL (http://localhost:8000)
- Let Claude know it can use the following tools:
  - `find_player` - Search for players by name
  - `get_player_sessions` - Get a player's recent sessions
  - `get_poi_metrics` - Get POI metrics for a specific session
  - `get_specific_metric` - Get specific metrics for a session
  - `compare_metric_over_time` - Compare metrics across sessions
  - `get_traq_id` - Get a player's TRAQ ID

3. **Test the Connection**:
You can test if everything is working by asking Claude to perform a simple query, like:
"Find information about player John Smith"

4. **Using the Tools**:
Once configured, you can ask Claude to:
- Search for players
- Get session data
- Compare metrics over time
- Look up specific metrics
- Get TRAQ IDs

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process? For example:
1. Testing the server connection
2. Setting up a specific query
3. Troubleshooting if something isn't working
4. Adding more tools or functionality

Let me know what you'd like to focus on next!

_**User**_

i want this to configure in claude for my coworkers whop are not techincal. how do i adapt it and make it work 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the error - we need to fix the server setup and make it more user-friendly for non-technical users. Let me help you modify the code to make it work and be easier to use.

First, let's fix the server setup error:



---

```diff
  from datetime import datetime
  from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
+ import uvicorn
+ import logging
+ 
+ # Set up logging
+ logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
+ logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  
  # Database connection setup
  async def get_db_pool():
-     return await asyncpg.create_pool(
+     try:
+         pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
              host='10.200.200.107', 
              user='readonlyuser', 
              password='pKufhAALb7r9Z0x', 
              database='theia_pitching_db'
          )
+         logger.info("Successfully connected to database")
+         return pool
+     except Exception as e:
+         logger.error(f"Failed to connect to database: {str(e)}")
+         raise
  
  # Lifespan function to manage DB connection
  @asynccontextmanager
  async def lifespan(app: FastMCP):
+     try:
          app.db_pool = await get_db_pool()
          yield {"db_pool": app.db_pool}
+     finally:
+         if hasattr(app, 'db_pool'):
              await app.db_pool.close()
+             logger.info("Database connection closed")
  
  # Initialize MCP with lifespan and dependencies
```

```diff
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
-     import uvicorn
-     uvicorn.run(mcp.app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
+     try:
+         logger.info("Starting Driveline Data Query Server...")
+         uvicorn.run(mcp.create_app(), host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
+     except Exception as e:
+         logger.error(f"Failed to start server: {str(e)}")
+         raise
```

---

Now, to make this work for non-technical users, here's what you need to do:

1. **Create a Simple Installation Guide**:
Create a file called `README.md` with these instructions:



---

```diff
- 
+ # Driveline Data Query Tool
+ 
+ This tool allows you to query Driveline data through Claude AI. It provides easy access to player information, session data, and performance metrics.
+ 
+ ## Quick Start Guide
+ 
+ 1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
+    - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
+    - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
+ 
+ 2. **Install Required Packages**:
+    - Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)
+    - Run this command:
+    ```
+    pip install fastmcp asyncpg uvicorn
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. **Start the Server**:
+    - Open Command Prompt/Terminal
+    - Navigate to the folder containing `driveline_query.py`
+    - Run:
+    ```
+    python driveline_query.py
+    ```
+    - You should see: "Starting Driveline Data Query Server..."
+ 
+ 4. **Using with Claude**:
+    - Keep the server running
+    - In Claude, you can now ask questions like:
+      - "Find information about player John Smith"
+      - "Show me the last 5 sessions for player Jane Doe"
+      - "Compare velocity metrics for player Mike Johnson over the last 3 sessions"
+ 
+ ## Common Questions
+ 
+ Q: How do I know if the server is running?
+ A: You should see "Starting Driveline Data Query Server..." in the command prompt/terminal.
+ 
+ Q: What if I get an error?
+ A: Check that:
+ - Python is installed correctly
+ - All packages are installed
+ - The database connection is working
+ - No other program is using port 8000
+ 
+ ## Available Commands
+ 
+ You can ask Claude to:
+ - Find players by name
+ - Get session data
+ - View POI metrics
+ - Compare metrics over time
+ - Get TRAQ IDs
+ 
+ ## Support
+ 
+ If you encounter any issues, please contact your system administrator. 
```

---

2. **Create a Batch File for Easy Startup**:
For Windows users, create a file called `start_server.bat`:




---

```diff
- 
+ @echo off
+ echo Starting Driveline Data Query Server...
+ python driveline_query.py
+ pause 
```

---

Now your non-technical coworkers can:

1. Follow the simple README instructions
2. Double-click `start_server.bat` to start the server
3. Use Claude to query the data

To distribute this to your coworkers:

1. Create a zip file containing:
   - `driveline_query.py`
   - `README.md`
   - `start_server.bat`

2. Share these instructions:
   - Download and unzip the files
   - Follow the README instructions
   - Double-click `start_server.bat` to start
   - Use Claude to ask questions about the data

Would you like me to:
1. Add more error handling or user-friendly messages?
2. Create additional documentation?
3. Add more example queries for Claude?
4. Make any other improvements to make it more user-friendly?

What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

Expose data through Resources (think GET endpoints; load info into context)
Provide functionality through Tools (think POST/PUT endpoints; execute actions)
Define interaction patterns through Prompts (reusable templates)
And more!
FastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building and interacting with these servers.

Why FastMCP?
The MCP protocol is powerful but implementing it involves a lot of boilerplate - server setup, protocol handlers, content types, error management. FastMCP handles all the complex protocol details and server management, so you can focus on building great tools. It’s designed to be high-level and Pythonic; in most cases, decorating a function is all you need.

FastMCP aims to be:

🚀 Fast: High-level interface means less code and faster development

🍀 Simple: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate

🐍 Pythonic: Feels natural to Python developers

🔍 Complete: FastMCP aims to provide a full implementation of the core MCP specification for both servers and clients

Key Features
Servers
Create servers with minimal boilerplate using intuitive decorators
Proxy existing servers to modify configuration or transport
Compose servers by into complex applications
Generate servers from OpenAPI specs or FastAPI objects
Clients
Interact with MCP servers programmatically
Connect to any MCP server using any transport
Test your servers without manual intervention
Innovate with core MCP capabilities like LLM sampling
What's New in v2?
FastMCP 1.0 made it so easy to build MCP servers that it's now part of the official Model Context Protocol Python SDK! For basic use cases, you can use the upstream version by importing mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP (or installing fastmcp=1.0).

Based on how the MCP ecosystem is evolving, FastMCP 2.0 builds on that foundation to introduce a variety of new features (and more experimental ideas). It adds advanced features like proxying and composing MCP servers, as well as automatically generating them from OpenAPI specs or FastAPI objects. FastMCP 2.0 also introduces new client-side functionality like LLM sampling.

Documentation
📚 FastMCP's documentation is available at gofastmcp.com.

Installation
We strongly recommend installing FastMCP with uv, as it is required for deploying servers via the CLI:

uv pip install fastmcp
Note: on macOS, uv may need to be installed with Homebrew (brew install uv) in order to make it available to the Claude Desktop app.

For development, install with:

# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp.git
cd fastmcp
# Install with dev dependencies
uv sync
Quickstart
Let's create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

# server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Demo")

# Add an addition tool
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Add a dynamic greeting resource
@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")
def get_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Get a personalized greeting"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
You can install this server in Claude Desktop and interact with it right away by running:

fastmcp install server.py
MCP Inspector

Core Concepts
These are the building blocks for creating MCP servers, using the familiar decorator-based approach.

The FastMCP Server
The central object representing your MCP application. It handles connections, protocol details, and routing.

from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a named server
mcp = FastMCP("My App")

# Specify dependencies needed when deployed via `fastmcp install`
mcp = FastMCP("My App", dependencies=["pandas", "numpy"])
Tools
Tools allow LLMs to perform actions by executing your Python functions. They are ideal for tasks that involve computation, external API calls, or side effects.

Decorate synchronous or asynchronous functions with @mcp.tool(). FastMCP automatically generates the necessary MCP schema based on type hints and docstrings. Pydantic models can be used for complex inputs.

import httpx
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserInfo(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    notify: bool = False

@mcp.tool()
async def send_notification(user: UserInfo, message: str) -> dict:
    """Sends a notification to a user if requested."""
    if user.notify:
        # Simulate sending notification
        print(f"Notifying user {user.user_id}: {message}")
        return {"status": "sent", "user_id": user.user_id}
    return {"status": "skipped", "user_id": user.user_id}

@mcp.tool()
def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> float:
    """Gets the current price for a stock ticker."""
    # Replace with actual API call
    prices = {"AAPL": 180.50, "GOOG": 140.20}
    return prices.get(ticker.upper(), 0.0)
Resources
Resources expose data to LLMs. They should primarily provide information without significant computation or side effects (like GET requests).

Decorate functions with @mcp.resource("your://uri"). Use curly braces {} in the URI to define dynamic resources (templates) where parts of the URI become function parameters.

# Static resource returning simple text
@mcp.resource("config://app-version")
def get_app_version() -> str:
    """Returns the application version."""
    return "v2.1.0"

# Dynamic resource template expecting a 'user_id' from the URI
@mcp.resource("db://users/{user_id}/email")
async def get_user_email(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves the email address for a given user ID."""
    # Replace with actual database lookup
    emails = {"123": "alice@example.com", "456": "bob@example.com"}
    return emails.get(user_id, "not_found@example.com")

# Resource returning JSON data
@mcp.resource("data://product-categories")
def get_categories() -> list[str]:
    """Returns a list of available product categories."""
    return ["Electronics", "Books", "Home Goods"]
Prompts
Prompts define reusable templates or interaction patterns for the LLM. They help guide the LLM on how to use your server's capabilities effectively.

Decorate functions with @mcp.prompt(). The function should return the desired prompt content, which can be a simple string, a Message object (like UserMessage or AssistantMessage), or a list of these.

from fastmcp.prompts.base import UserMessage, AssistantMessage

@mcp.prompt()
def ask_review(code_snippet: str) -> str:
    """Generates a standard code review request."""
    return f"Please review the following code snippet for potential bugs and style issues:\n```python\n{code_snippet}\n```"

@mcp.prompt()
def debug_session_start(error_message: str) -> list[Message]:
    """Initiates a debugging help session."""
    return [
        UserMessage(f"I encountered an error:\n{error_message}"),
        AssistantMessage("Okay, I can help with that. Can you provide the full traceback and tell me what you were trying to do?")
    ]
Context
Gain access to MCP server capabilities within your tool or resource functions by adding a parameter type-hinted with fastmcp.Context.

from fastmcp import Context, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Context Demo")

@mcp.resource("system://status")
async def get_system_status(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Checks system status and logs information."""
    await ctx.info("Checking system status...")
    # Perform checks
    await ctx.report_progress(1, 1) # Report completion
    return {"status": "OK", "load": 0.5, "client": ctx.client_id}

@mcp.tool()
async def process_large_file(file_uri: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Processes a large file, reporting progress and reading resources."""
    await ctx.info(f"Starting processing for {file_uri}")
    # Read the resource using the context
    file_content_resource = await ctx.read_resource(file_uri)
    file_content = file_content_resource[0].content # Assuming single text content
    lines = file_content.splitlines()
    total_lines = len(lines)

    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        # Process line...
        if (i + 1) % 100 == 0: # Report progress every 100 lines
            await ctx.report_progress(i + 1, total_lines)

    await ctx.info(f"Finished processing {file_uri}")
    return f"Processed {total_lines} lines."
The Context object provides:

Logging: ctx.debug(), ctx.info(), ctx.warning(), ctx.error()
Progress Reporting: ctx.report_progress(current, total)
Resource Access: await ctx.read_resource(uri)
Request Info: ctx.request_id, ctx.client_id
Sampling (Advanced): await ctx.sample(...) to ask the connected LLM client for completions.
Images
Easily handle image input and output using the fastmcp.Image helper class.

from fastmcp import FastMCP, Image
from PIL import Image as PILImage
import io

mcp = FastMCP("Image Demo")

@mcp.tool()
def create_thumbnail(image_data: Image) -> Image:
    """Creates a 100x100 thumbnail from the provided image."""
    img = PILImage.open(io.BytesIO(image_data.data)) # Assumes image_data received as Image with bytes
    img.thumbnail((100, 100))
    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    img.save(buffer, format="PNG")
    # Return a new Image object with the thumbnail data
    return Image(data=buffer.getvalue(), format="png")

@mcp.tool()
def load_image_from_disk(path: str) -> Image:
    """Loads an image from the specified path."""
    # Handles reading file and detecting format based on extension
    return Image(path=path)
FastMCP handles the conversion to/from the base64-encoded format required by the MCP protocol.

MCP Clients
The Client class lets you interact with any MCP server (not just FastMCP ones) from Python code:

from fastmcp import Client

async with Client("path/to/server") as client:
    # Call a tool
    result = await client.call_tool("weather", {"location": "San Francisco"})
    print(result)
    
    # Read a resource
    res = await client.read_resource("db://users/123/profile")
    print(res)
You can connect to servers using any supported transport protocol (Stdio, SSE, FastMCP, etc.). If you don't specify a transport, the Client class automatically attempts to detect an appropriate one from your connection string or server object.

Client Methods
The Client class exposes several methods for interacting with MCP servers.

async with Client("path/to/server") as client:
    # List available tools
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    
    # List available resources
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    
    # Call a tool with arguments
    result = await client.call_tool("generate_report", {"user_id": 123})
    
    # Read a resource
    user_data = await client.read_resource("db://users/123/profile")
        
    # Get a prompt
    greeting = await client.get_prompt("welcome", {"name": "Alice"})
    
    # Send progress updates
    await client.progress("task-123", 50, 100)  # 50% complete
    
    # Basic connectivity testing
    await client.ping()
These methods correspond directly to MCP protocol operations, making it easy to interact with any MCP-compatible server (not just FastMCP ones).

Transport Options
FastMCP supports various transport protocols for connecting to MCP servers:

from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import (
    SSETransport, 
    PythonStdioTransport, 
    FastMCPTransport
)

# Connect to a server over SSE (common for web-based MCP servers)
async with Client(SSETransport("http://localhost:8000/mcp")) as client:
    # Use client here...

# Connect to a Python script using stdio (useful for local tools)
async with Client(PythonStdioTransport("path/to/script.py")) as client:
    # Use client here...

# Connect directly to a FastMCP server object in the same process
from your_app import mcp_server
async with Client(FastMCPTransport(mcp_server)) as client:
    # Use client here...
Common transport options include:

SSETransport: Connect to a server via Server-Sent Events (HTTP)
PythonStdioTransport: Run a Python script and communicate via stdio
FastMCPTransport: Connect directly to a FastMCP server object
WSTransport: Connect via WebSockets
In addition, if you pass a connection string or FastMCP server object to the Client constructor, it will try to automatically detect the appropriate transport.

LLM Sampling
Sampling is an MCP feature that allows a server to request a completion from the client LLM, enabling sophisticated use cases while maintaining security and privacy on the server.

import marvin  # Or any other LLM client
from fastmcp import Client, Context, FastMCP
from fastmcp.client.sampling import RequestContext, SamplingMessage, SamplingParams

# -- SERVER SIDE --
# Create a server that requests LLM completions from the client

mcp = FastMCP("Sampling Example")

@mcp.tool()
async def generate_poem(topic: str, context: Context) -> str:
    """Generate a short poem about the given topic."""
    # The server requests a completion from the client LLM
    response = await context.sample(
        f"Write a short poem about {topic}",
        system_prompt="You are a talented poet who writes concise, evocative verses."
    )
    return response.text

@mcp.tool()
async def summarize_document(document_uri: str, context: Context) -> str:
    """Summarize a document using client-side LLM capabilities."""
    # First read the document as a resource
    doc_resource = await context.read_resource(document_uri)
    doc_content = doc_resource[0].content  # Assuming single text content
    
    # Then ask the client LLM to summarize it
    response = await context.sample(
        f"Summarize the following document:\n\n{doc_content}",
        system_prompt="You are an expert summarizer. Create a concise summary."
    )
    return response.text

# -- CLIENT SIDE --
# Create a client that handles the sampling requests

async def sampling_handler(
    messages: list[SamplingMessage],
    params: SamplingParams,
    ctx: RequestContext,
) -> str:
    """Handle sampling requests from the server using your preferred LLM."""
    # Extract the messages and system prompt
    prompt = [m.content.text for m in messages if m.content.type == "text"]
    system_instruction = params.systemPrompt or "You are a helpful assistant."
    
    # Use your preferred LLM client to generate completions
    return await marvin.say_async(
        message=prompt,
        instructions=system_instruction,
    )

# Connect them together
async with Client(mcp, sampling_handler=sampling_handler) as client:
    result = await client.call_tool("generate_poem", {"topic": "autumn leaves"})
    print(result.content[0].text)
This pattern is powerful because:

The server can delegate text generation to the client LLM
The server remains focused on business logic and data handling
The client maintains control over which LLM is used and how requests are handled
No sensitive data needs to be sent to external APIs
Roots Access
FastMCP exposes the MCP roots functionality, allowing clients to specify which file system roots they can access. This creates a secure boundary for tools that need to work with files. Note that the server must account for client roots explicitly.

from fastmcp import Client, RootsList

# Specify file roots that the client can access
roots = ["file:///path/to/allowed/directory"]

async with Client(mcp_server, roots=roots) as client:
    # Now tools in the MCP server can access files in the specified roots
    await client.call_tool("process_file", {"filename": "data.csv"})
Advanced Features
Building on the core concepts, FastMCP v2 introduces powerful features for more complex scenarios:

Proxy Servers
Create a FastMCP server that acts as an intermediary, proxying requests to another MCP endpoint (which could be a server or another client connection).

Use Cases:

Transport Conversion: Expose a server running on Stdio (like many local tools) over SSE or WebSockets, making it accessible to web clients or Claude Desktop.
Adding Functionality: Wrap an existing server to add authentication, request logging, or modified tool behavior.
Aggregating Servers: Combine multiple backend MCP servers behind a single proxy interface (though mount might be simpler for this).
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import PythonStdioTransport

# Create a client that connects to the original server
proxy_client = Client(
    transport=PythonStdioTransport('path/to/original_stdio_server.py'),
)

# Create a proxy server that connects to the client and exposes its capabilities
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(proxy_client, name="Stdio-to-SSE Proxy")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy.run(transport='sse')
FastMCP.as_proxy is an async classmethod. It connects to the target, discovers its capabilities, and dynamically builds the proxy server instance.

Composing MCP Servers
Structure larger MCP applications by creating modular FastMCP servers and "mounting" them onto a parent server. This automatically handles prefixing for tool names and resource URIs, preventing conflicts.

from fastmcp import FastMCP

# --- Weather MCP ---
weather_mcp = FastMCP("Weather Service")

@weather_mcp.tool()
def get_forecast(city: str): 
    return f"Sunny in {city}"

@weather_mcp.resource("data://temp/{city}")
def get_temp(city: str): 
    return 25.0

# --- News MCP ---
news_mcp = FastMCP("News Service")

@news_mcp.tool()
def fetch_headlines():
    return ["Big news!", "Other news"]

@news_mcp.resource("data://latest_story")
def get_story():
    return "A story happened."

# --- Composite MCP ---

mcp = FastMCP("Composite")

# Mount sub-apps with prefixes
mcp.mount("weather", weather_mcp) # Tools prefixed "weather/", resources prefixed "weather+"
mcp.mount("news", news_mcp)       # Tools prefixed "news/", resources prefixed "news+"

@mcp.tool()
def ping(): 
    return "Composite OK"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
This promotes code organization and reusability for complex MCP systems.

OpenAPI & FastAPI Generation
Leverage your existing web APIs by automatically generating FastMCP servers from them.

By default, the following rules are applied:

GET requests -> MCP resources
GET requests with path parameters -> MCP resource templates
All other HTTP methods -> MCP tools
You can override these rules to customize or even ignore certain endpoints.

From FastAPI:

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Your existing FastAPI application
fastapi_app = FastAPI(title="My Existing API")

@fastapi_app.get("/status")
def get_status(): 
    return {"status": "running"}

@fastapi_app.post("/items")
def create_item(name: str, price: float): 
    return {"id": 1, "name": name, "price": price}

# Generate an MCP server directly from the FastAPI app
mcp_server = FastMCP.from_fastapi(fastapi_app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp_server.run()
From an OpenAPI Specification:

import httpx
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Load the OpenAPI spec (dict)
# with open("my_api_spec.json", "r") as f:
#     openapi_spec = json.load(f)
openapi_spec = { ... } # Your spec dict

# Create an HTTP client to make requests to the actual API endpoint
http_client = httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="https://api.yourservice.com")

# Generate the MCP server
mcp_server = FastMCP.from_openapi(openapi_spec, client=http_client)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp_server.run()
Running Your Server
Choose the method that best suits your needs:

Development Mode (Recommended for Building & Testing)
Use fastmcp dev for an interactive testing environment with the MCP Inspector.

fastmcp dev your_server_file.py
# With temporary dependencies
fastmcp dev your_server_file.py --with pandas --with numpy
# With local package in editable mode
fastmcp dev your_server_file.py --with-editable .
Claude Desktop Integration (For Regular Use)
Use fastmcp install to set up your server for persistent use within the Claude Desktop app. It handles creating an isolated environment using uv.

fastmcp install your_server_file.py
# With a custom name in Claude
fastmcp install your_server_file.py --name "My Analysis Tool"
# With extra packages and environment variables
fastmcp install server.py --with requests -v API_KEY=123 -f .env
Direct Execution (For Advanced Use Cases)
Run your server script directly for custom deployments or integrations outside of Claude. You manage the environment and dependencies yourself.

Add to your your_server_file.py:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run() # Assuming 'mcp' is your FastMCP instance
Run with:

python your_server_file.py
# or
uv run python your_server_file.py
Server Object Names
If your FastMCP instance is not named mcp, server, or app, specify it using file:object syntax for the dev and install commands:

fastmcp dev my_module.py:my_mcp_instance
fastmcp install api.py:api_app
Examples

I see the issue now. Based on the documentation, we need to modify how we run the FastMCP server. The error occurs because we're trying to use `create_app()` which doesn't exist in FastMCP. Let me fix this:



---

```diff
      try:
          logger.info("Starting Driveline Data Query Server...")
-         uvicorn.run(mcp.create_app(), host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
+         mcp.run()
      except Exception as e:
          logger.error(f"Failed to start server: {str(e)}")
```

---

Now, let me update the README to reflect the correct way to use this with Claude:




---

```diff
  ## Quick Start Guide
  
- 1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):

     - You should see: "Starting Driveline Data Query Server..."
  
+ 3. **Install in Claude**:
+    - In Claude, use the command:
+    ```
+    fastmcp install driveline_query.py
+    ```
+    - This will make the tools available in Claude
+ 
  4. **Using with Claude**:
-    - Keep the server running
-    - In Claude, you can now ask questions like:
+    - Once installed, you can ask Claude questions like:
       - "Find information about player John Smith"
       - "Show me the last 5 sessions for player Jane Doe"
```

```diff
  Q: What if I get an error?
  A: Check that:
- - Python is installed correctly
- - All packages are installed
+ - All packages are installed correctly
  - The database connection is working
- - No other program is using port 8000
+ - No other program is using the same port
  
  ## Available Commands
```

The key changes I've made:

1. Fixed the server startup code to use `mcp.run()` instead of trying to use uvicorn directly
2. Updated the README to reflect the correct way to use FastMCP with Claude
3. Simplified the installation process
4. Added the crucial step of installing the MCP in Claude using `fastmcp install`

To use this with your coworkers:

1. They should first install the required packages:
```bash
pip install fastmcp asyncpg
```

2. They can then start the server:
```bash
python driveline_query.py
```

3. In Claude, they need to run:
```
fastmcp install driveline_query.py
```

4. After that, they can start asking Claude questions about the data.

The server will handle all the database connections and provide the data to Claude through the MCP protocol. Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail or make any additional changes?

_**Assistant**_

I see the error - the server is failing to connect to the database with a semaphore timeout error. This typically happens when there are network connectivity issues or the database server is not accessible. Let me help you fix this.

First, let's add better error handling and connection retry logic to the database connection:




---

```diff
  import uvicorn
  import logging
+ import asyncio
+ from typing import Optional
  
  # Set up logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  
- # Database connection setup
- async def get_db_pool():
+ # Database connection setup with retry logic
+ async def get_db_pool(max_retries: int = 3, retry_delay: int = 5) -> Optional[asyncpg.Pool]:
+     retry_count = 0
+     last_error = None
+     
+     while retry_count < max_retries:
          try:
+             logger.info(f"Attempting to connect to database (attempt {retry_count + 1}/{max_retries})...")
              pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
                  host='10.200.200.107', 
                  user='readonlyuser', 
                  password='pKufhAALb7r9Z0x', 
-             database='theia_pitching_db'
+                 database='theia_pitching_db',
+                 command_timeout=60  # Increase timeout to 60 seconds
              )
              logger.info("Successfully connected to database")
              return pool
          except Exception as e:
-         logger.error(f"Failed to connect to database: {str(e)}")
-         raise
+             last_error = e
+             logger.warning(f"Database connection attempt {retry_count + 1} failed: {str(e)}")
+             if retry_count < max_retries - 1:
+                 logger.info(f"Retrying in {retry_delay} seconds...")
+                 await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)
+             retry_count += 1
+     
+     logger.error(f"Failed to connect to database after {max_retries} attempts. Last error: {str(last_error)}")
+     raise last_error
  
  # Lifespan function to manage DB connection
```

---

Now, let's also update the README to include troubleshooting steps for database connection issues:




---

```diff
  - No other program is using the same port
  
+ ## Troubleshooting Database Connection
+ 
+ If you see a "semaphore timeout" or database connection error:
+ 
+ 1. **Check Network Connectivity**:
+    - Ensure you're connected to the correct network
+    - Try pinging the database server: `ping 10.200.200.107`
+ 
+ 2. **Verify Database Server**:
+    - Confirm the database server is running
+    - Check if other users can connect to the database
+ 
+ 3. **Check Firewall Settings**:
+    - Ensure port 5432 (PostgreSQL default) is open
+    - Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
+ 
+ 4. **Retry Connection**:
+    - The server will automatically retry 3 times
+    - Wait for all retry attempts to complete
+    - Check the logs for specific error messages
+ 
+ 5. **Contact Support**:
+    - If issues persist, contact your system administrator
+    - Provide the complete error message from the logs
+ 
  ## Available Commands
  
```

---

The changes I've made:

1. Added retry logic to the database connection:
   - Will attempt to connect 3 times
   - Waits 5 seconds between attempts
   - Increased command timeout to 60 seconds
   - Better error logging

2. Added detailed troubleshooting steps in the README

To test if the database server is accessible, you can try:
```bash
ping 10.200.200.107
```

If the ping fails, it means there's a network connectivity issue. You should:
1. Check if you're on the correct network
2. Verify the database server IP address is correct
3. Check if the database server is running
4. Ensure your firewall isn't blocking the connection

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific error handling?
2. Modify the retry parameters?
3. Add a test connection function?
4. Make any other improvements?
