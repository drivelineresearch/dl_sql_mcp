_**Assistant**_

I'll help you analyze and enhance the script to ensure it can handle all these pitching metrics through natural language queries. Let me first examine the current code and then make necessary improvements.

First, let me search for any existing metric-related code:

Based on the code review, I can see that the script already has good functionality for querying pitching metrics, but we can enhance it to better support natural language queries for all the metrics you've listed. Let me make some improvements to make it more user-friendly and comprehensive.

I'll add a new tool that will help with natural language queries and improve the existing tools. Here's what I'm going to do:

1. Add a new tool for natural language metric queries
2. Enhance the existing tools to better handle the full range of metrics
3. Add better documentation and error handling

Let me make these changes:

      print("Starting Driveline Data Query MCP server...")
```

---

Now let me update the README to include information about the new natural language query functionality:



---

```diff
  Once installed, you can use the following commands in Claude Desktop:
  
+ ### Basic Commands
  - `find_player("player name")` - Search for a player by name
  - `get_player_sessions("player name")` - Get recent sessions for a player
```

```diff
  - `compare_metric_over_time("player name", "metric_name")` - Compare a metric across sessions
  - `get_traq_id("player name")` - Find a player's TRAQ ID
+ 
+ ### Natural Language Queries
+ The tool now supports natural language queries for pitching metrics. You can ask questions like:
+ - "What was his max velocity?"
+ - "How was his shoulder rotation?"
+ - "What's his stride length?"
+ - "Show me his arm slot"
+ - "What's his timing like?"
+ 
+ Example usage:
+ ```python
+ query_pitching_metrics("John Smith", "What was his max velocity?")
+ ```
+ 
+ The tool understands common terms and aliases for metrics, including:
+ - Velocity/Speed
+ - Shoulder Rotation
+ - Elbow Extension
+ - Torso Rotation
+ - Hip Shoulder Separation
+ - Elbow Flexion
+ - Shoulder External Rotation
+ - Knee Extension
+ - Stride
+ - Arm Slot
+ - Timing
  
  ## Troubleshooting
```

---

I've made several improvements to support natural language queries for all the pitching metrics you listed:

1. Added a new `query_pitching_metrics` tool that:
   - Accepts natural language queries about metrics
   - Maps common terms to actual database column names
   - Returns comprehensive results including averages, maximums, and minimums
   - Supports querying multiple sessions at once

2. The tool now supports all the metrics you listed through:
   - Direct column name matching
   - Common aliases and natural language terms
   - Flexible query matching

3. Enhanced the documentation to:
   - Explain the natural language query capabilities
   - List all supported metrics and their aliases
   - Provide examples of how to use the new functionality

The tool can now handle queries like:
- "What was his max velocity?"
- "How was his shoulder rotation?"
- "What's his stride length?"
- "Show me his arm slot"
- "What's his timing like?"

And it will automatically map these to the appropriate database columns and return comprehensive results.

Would you like me to make any additional improvements or add support for any other specific types of queries?

_**User**_

when i run the file it will update the config automatically right?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's correct! Looking at your `claude_desktop_config.json`, the MCP server is already configured to run with the correct Python path and script location. When you run `driveline_query.py`, it will:

1. Start the MCP server
2. Connect to the database
3. Be ready to accept queries through Claude Desktop

The configuration in your `claude_desktop_config.json` shows:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "driveline": {
            "command": "C:\\Users\\alex.britton\\AppData\\Local\\miniconda3\\envs\\local\\python.exe",
            "args": [
                "C:\\Users\\alex.britton\\Desktop\\db_MCPserver\\driveline_query.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

So you don't need to manually configure anything - just run the script and it will work with your existing Claude Desktop setup. The script will automatically:
- Install any missing dependencies (like aiomysql)
- Connect to the database
- Start the MCP server
- Be ready to handle queries through Claude Desktop

Would you like me to update the Notion page to reflect this simpler setup?

---

_**User**_

make sure that we supply the config and replace the path with their path for python in case it doesnt autaomcatically configure correctly

                "YOUR_SCRIPT_PATH"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
3. Replace:
   - `YOUR_PYTHON_PATH` with your Python executable path (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\miniconda3\envs\local\python.exe`)
   - `YOUR_SCRIPT_PATH` with the full path to `driveline_query.py`

### 3. Start the Tool
1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory containing `driveline_query.py`
3. Run:
```bash
python driveline_query.py
```
4. You should see "Starting Driveline Data Query MCP server..."

## Using the Tool
Once running, you can use natural language queries like:
- "What was his max velocity?"
- "How was his shoulder rotation?"
- "What's his stride length?"

Example command:
```python
query_pitching_metrics("John Smith", "What was his max velocity?")
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Python is installed correctly
2. Verify the config file paths are correct
3. Verify network access to the database
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Try running the script again

## Support

2. Download or create `driveline_query.py` in this folder
3. Open Claude Desktop
4. Go to Settings > Tools
5. Click "Add Tool"
6. Select `driveline_query.py`
7. Check "Install with aiomysql"

## Step 4: Configure the Tool
1. Navigate to `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Add or update the config with:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "driveline": {
            "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Local\\miniconda3\\envs\\local\\python.exe",
            "args": [
                "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Desktop\\driveline_mcp\\driveline_query.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
3. Replace the paths with your actual paths:
   - `YourName` with your Windows username
   - Update the Python path if you're not using miniconda
   - Update the script path to where you saved `driveline_query.py`

## Step 5: Test the Setup
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Try a simple query like:
```python
query_pitching_metrics("John Smith", "What was his max velocity?")
```
3. If it works, you're all set!
4. If you get an error, check:
   - Python is installed correctly
   - The config file paths are correct
   - You have network access to the database

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Python installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Verify the config file exists and has correct paths
3. Make sure you have network access to the database
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Contact your system administrator if problems persist

That's it! Once set up, you can use natural language queries to access pitching data through Claude Desktop.

tell them to run the file in the commmand prompt because that updates config and then claude isnt like that you go to file, settings, mcp, then edit config and make sure the file is correct then you restart claude and tool should work
