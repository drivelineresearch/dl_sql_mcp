# Querying Metrics and User Accessibility (2025-04-14 20:28Z)

_**User**_

so this format works and is working in claude desktop. i have a few questions though

1. Why does it only allow me to pick from select metrics. i want to be able to query the table and get any metric that is in the table.

2. Secondly is this the easiest way to distribute this to non technical usres?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help address your questions:

1. Regarding the limited metric selection:
Looking at the code, I can see that the metrics are hardcoded in the `get_poi_metrics` function. Let me search for the table structure to understand what metrics are available.

I can see that the code already has a function called `get_specific_metric` that allows querying any metric from the `poi` table. This function validates that the metric exists in the table before querying it. The limitation you're experiencing is likely because the `get_poi_metrics` function is hardcoded to only return specific metrics.

Let me propose a modification to make the system more flexible:



---

```diff
              return {"error": f"No session found with ID {session_id}"}

          }
  
```

2. Regarding distribution to non-technical users:
The current setup using Claude Desktop is actually one of the more user-friendly approaches for non-technical users. Here's why:

1. **No Installation Required**: Users only need to have Claude Desktop installed, which is a simple download and install process.
2. **Natural Language Interface**: Users can interact with the data using natural language, which is much more intuitive than learning SQL or a specific query language.
3. **Centralized Configuration**: The configuration is managed through a simple JSON file that can be distributed to users.

However, there are a few ways to make it even easier for non-technical users:

1. **Create an Installer**: You could create a simple installer that:
   - Installs Python and required dependencies
   - Sets up the configuration file
   - Adds the tool to Claude Desktop automatically

2. **Documentation**: Create a simple guide with common queries and examples that users can copy/paste.

3. **Web Interface**: For users who don't want to use Claude Desktop, you could create a simple web interface that wraps these same queries in a user-friendly UI.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these additional distribution methods? Or would you like to see how the modified metrics query works first?

---

_**User**_

i want the user to be able to do everything from command terminal. does this solution do that?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, the current solution requires Claude Desktop to be installed and configured. Let me help you create a command-line interface (CLI) version that would allow users to run queries directly from the terminal.

I'll create a new file that wraps the existing functionality into a CLI interface:


---

```diff

+         return
+ 
+     try:
+         if args.command == 'find-player':
+             result = await find_player(args.name)
+         elif args.command == 'get-sessions':
+             result = await get_player_sessions(args.name, args.limit)
+         elif args.command == 'get-metrics':
+             result = await get_poi_metrics(args.session_id)
+         elif args.command == 'get-specific-metric':
+             result = await get_specific_metric(args.session_id, args.metric)

+             result = await get_traq_id(args.player_name)
+         else:
+             parser.print_help()
+             return
+ 
+         # Print the result in a readable format
+         print(json.dumps(result, indent=2, default=str))
+

+         print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
+     finally:
+         db_pool.close()
+         await db_pool.wait_closed()
+ 
+ if __name__ == "__main__":
+     asyncio.run(main()) 
```

- - Compare metrics over time
- - Get TRAQ IDs
- 
- ## Installation in Claude Desktop
+ This package provides tools to query Driveline player data through both a CLI interface and Claude Desktop integration.
+ 
+ ## Installation
+ 
+ 1. Install Python 3.10 or higher
+ 2. Install the required packages:
+    ```bash
+    pip install -r requirements.txt
+    ```
+ 
+ ## CLI Usage
+ 
+ The CLI provides the following commands:
+ 
+ ### Find a Player
+ ```bash
+ python driveline_cli.py find-player "John Smith"
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Get Player Sessions
+ ```bash
+ python driveline_cli.py get-sessions "John Smith" --limit 5
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Get POI Metrics for a Session
+ ```bash
+ python driveline_cli.py get-metrics 12345
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Get a Specific Metric
+ ```bash
+ python driveline_cli.py get-specific-metric 12345 pitch_speed_mph
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Compare Metrics Over Time
+ ```bash
+ python driveline_cli.py compare-metric "John Smith" pitch_speed_mph --sessions 3
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Get TRAQ ID
+ ```bash
+ python driveline_cli.py get-traq-id "John Smith"
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Claude Desktop Integration
+ 
+ You can also use these tools through Claude Desktop:
  
  1. Open Claude Desktop
```

```diff
  3. Wait for Claude to respond with "Installation complete"
  4. You're ready to use the Driveline Data Query tools!
- 
- ## Using the Tools in Claude Desktop
- 
- Simply type your request in natural language. For example:
- 
- ### Finding Players
- - "Find player John Smith"
- - "Look up player Jane Doe"
- - "Search for players named Mike"
- 
- ### Viewing Sessions
- - "Show me recent sessions for John Smith"
- - "Get the last 3 sessions for Jane Doe"
- - "List all sessions for Mike Johnson"
- 
- ### Checking Metrics
- - "Get POI metrics for session 12345"
- - "Show me pitch speed for session 12345"
- - "What was the velocity in session 12345?"
- 
- ### Comparing Performance
- - "Compare pitch speed for John Smith over last 5 sessions"
- - "Show me how Jane Doe's velocity has changed"
- - "Track Mike Johnson's shoulder IR velocity over time"
- 
- ### Getting TRAQ IDs
- - "What's John Smith's TRAQ ID?"
- - "Get the TRAQ ID for Jane Doe"
- - "Find Mike Johnson's TRAQ number"
  
  ## Tips for Best Results
  
  1. **Be Specific**: Include the player's full name when possible
- 2. **Use Natural Language**: Type your requests as you would ask a colleague
- 3. **Check Your Network**: Make sure you're connected to the Driveline network
- 4. **Session IDs**: When asking about specific sessions, include the session ID number
+ 2. **Check Your Network**: Make sure you're connected to the Driveline network
+ 3. **Session IDs**: When asking about specific sessions, include the session ID number
  
  ## Support
  
  If you encounter any issues:
  1. Make sure you're connected to the Driveline network
- 2. Try re-installing the server:
-    ```
-    fastmcp install driveline_query.py --name "Driveline Data Query" --with asyncpg
-    ```
+ 2. Check your Python installation and dependencies
  3. Contact your technical support team with:
     - The exact error message you see
```

---

Now users can:

1. Use the CLI directly from the terminal with commands like:
```bash
python driveline_cli.py find-player "John Smith"
python driveline_cli.py get-metrics 12345
```

2. Or continue using the Claude Desktop integration if they prefer the natural language interface.

The CLI version has several advantages:
1. No need for Claude Desktop installation
2. Can be scripted and automated
3. Can be integrated into other tools or workflows
4. More direct control over the queries

To use it, users just need to:
1. Install Python 3.10+
2. Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run the CLI commands as shown in the README

Would you like me to add any additional features to the CLI or make any modifications to make it more user-friendly?

_**User**_

no thats not what i mean. i mean for installation. take me through how someone else gets this on their claude

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. You want to know how to distribute this tool to other users so they can use it in their Claude Desktop. Let me explain the process:

1. First, you need to package your tool properly. Let me create a proper package structure:



---

```diff
  name = "driveline-query"
  version = "0.1.0"
- description = "Driveline Data Query Server for Claude"
+ description = "Driveline Data Query Tools for Claude Desktop"
  requires-python = ">=3.10"
  dependencies = [
      "fastmcp>=2.1.1",
-     "asyncpg>=0.29.0",
+     "aiomysql>=0.2.0",
      "mcp[cli]>=1.6.0",
  ]
  
  [build-system]
  requires = ["hatchling"]
- build-backend = "hatchling.build" 
+ build-backend = "hatchling.build"
+ 
+ [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
+ packages = ["driveline_query.py"] 
  
```

---

Now, here's how to distribute and install the tool:

1. **For the Distributor (You)**:
   ```bash
   # Build the package
   pip install build
   python -m build
   ```
   This will create a `dist` directory with a `.whl` file.

2. **For the End User**:
   They need to:
   1. Install Python 3.10+ if they haven't already
   2. Install the package:
      ```bash
      pip install driveline-query-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
      ```
   3. Open Claude Desktop
   4. Go to Settings > Tools
   5. Click "Add Tool"
   6. Select the `driveline_query.py` file from their Python environment
   7. Check "Install with aiomysql" when prompted

Let me create a more detailed installation guide for users:

To distribute this to other users, you would:

1. Build the package:
```bash
python -m build
```

2. Share the following with users:
- The `.whl` file from the `dist` directory
- The `INSTALL.md` guide
- The `README.md` for usage instructions

Users would then follow the steps in `INSTALL.md` to:
1. Install Python if needed
2. Install your package using pip
3. Add the tool to their Claude Desktop

This approach has several advantages:
1. Users don't need to clone any repositories
2. Dependencies are handled automatically
3. The installation process is standardized
4. Updates can be distributed as new `.whl` files

Would you like me to add any additional information to the installation guide or make any modifications to the package structure?
